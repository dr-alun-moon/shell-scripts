# shell-scripts

## Script refactoring 
The scripts `tidyup1` and `tidyup2` are solutions to the script refactoring exercise in [week 4](http://hesabu.net/kf5010/L04.html#using-shell-functions-in-practice) of [KF5010](http://hesabu.net/kf5010).

 * `tidyup1` is most like the solution expected of the exercise
 * `tidyup2` takes the simplification further, see the first [virtue of a programmer](http://threevirtues.com/)
